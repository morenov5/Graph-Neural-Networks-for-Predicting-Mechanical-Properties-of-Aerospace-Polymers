# Graph-Neural-Networks-for-Predicting-Mechanical-Properties-of-Aerospace-Polymers
GNN-based framework for predicting the elastic modulus of aerospace polymers under variable thermal and mechanical conditions. It uses atomic graph representations, environmental conditioning, and synthetic datasets to model material properties with high accuracy.
